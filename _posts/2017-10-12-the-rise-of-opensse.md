OpenSSE is a new project of an implementation of searchable encryption schemes. This blog will be about problems in the implementation, questions on the theory of searchable encryption, and new constructions.

In the meantime, look at the code on [GitHub]({{ site.git_address }}), and read the [documentation]({{ "/docs/home/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) (although the documentation pages might look quite empty for now, but that should be fixed soon).

Stay tuned...
