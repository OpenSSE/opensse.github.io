There is no contributing rule for now (this should change quickly).
However, we want that any new feature of the cryptographic toolkit to be covered by unit tests.
`crypto-tk` uses [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/OpenSSE/crypto-tk) for the CI, and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/OpenSSE/crypto-tk) for the coverage report.
